This repository contains my ongoing Data Warehouse projects, built for learning and hands-on practice with modern data engineering concepts, particularly the Medallion Architecture and PostgreSQL.

SQL Data Warehouse

It focuses on CRM and ERP source systems and is architected using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
